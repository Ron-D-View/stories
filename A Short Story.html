<h1>A Short Story</h1>


<p>A pebble has hit the particle accelerator.</p>
<p>At least, that's what we think happened. It couldn't have come from inside the reactor because we simply didn't add the mass and energy needed for the size of the initial explosion. Any bigger than a pebble and we'd be dead already. Luckily, we still have time before the explosion reaches us.</p>
<p>I told them we should have kept it underground, but nooooo, somebody wanted to stretch it across multiple fucking planets. So we could get more government funding. Next year. Which we'll likely never get to see.</p>

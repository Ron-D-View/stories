Math


T is absolute time, t is relative time, u is universe coordinate (measured in euzics), L is lifespan of a universe (T_heatdeath-T_bigbang), τ is calendar time
U is absolute universe, u is relative universe.


For T>>L, T≈2u/c
T_bigbang(u) = 2u/c
T_heatdeath(u) = 2u/c+L
c = 1 euzic / 1 second
1 euzic = 299.792Mm
τ=T-U

Rules

U is a spacelike dimension. I'm saying that now so I can't change it later. Fuck off. It makes the math easier.
* You can travel both left and right but every euzic is 1 second of travel at c.
* The equation for the moment of the Big Bang is t=2cu where +u is prin and -u is katapin.

Non-u-travel is like an unstable equilibrium. How unstable? Think laminar flow. Once some particle experiences u-travel, everything nearby begins to collapse.
